    "Text summarization methods can be classified into different types  \n",
    "<img src=\"img/text_sum_types.png\" alt=\"Markdown Monster icon\" style=\"float: center; margin-right: 10px;\" />  \n",
    "\n",
    "i. Based on input type:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Single Document, where the input length is short. Many of the early summarization systems dealt with single document summarization.\n",
    "    - Multi Document, where the input can be arbitrarily long.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Based on the purpose:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Generic, where the model makes no assumptions about the domain or content of the text to be summarized and treats all inputs as homogeneous. The majority of the work that has been done revolves around generic summarization.  \n",
    "    - Domain-specific, where the model uses domain-specific knowledge to form a more accurate summary. For example, summarizing research papers of a specific domain, biomedical documents, etc.  \n",
    "    - Query-based, where the summary only contains information which answers natural language questions about the input text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Based on output type:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Extractive, where important sentences are selected from the input text to form a summary. Most summarization approaches today are extractive in nature.  \n",
    "    - Abstractive, where the model forms its own phrases and sentences to offer a more coherent summary, like what a human would generate. This approach is definitely more appealing, but much more difficult than extractive summarization.  \n"

In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival.'"

      "Lashkar-e-Taiba's Kashmir commander Abu Dujana was killed in an encounter in a village in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir earlier this week. Dujana, who had managed to give the security forces a slip several times in the past, carried a bounty of Rs 15 lakh on his head.Reports say that Dujana had come to meet his wife when he was trapped inside a house in Hakripora village. Security officials involved in the encounter tried their best to convince Dujana to surrender but he refused, reports say.According to reports, Dujana rejected call for surrender from an Army officer. The Army had commissioned a local to start a telephonic conversation with Dujana. After initiating the talk, the local villager handed over the phone to the army officer.\"Kya haal hai? Maine kaha, kya haal hai (How are you. I asked, how are you)?\" Dujana is heard asking the officer. The officer replies: \"Humara haal chhor Dujana. Surrender kyun nahi kar deta. Tu galat kar rha hai (Why don't you surrender? You have married this girl. What you are doing isn't right.)\"When told that he is being used by Pakistani agencies as a pawn, Dujana, who sounded calm and unperturbed of the situation, said \"Hum nikley they shaheed hone. Main kya karu. Jisko game khelna hai, khelo. Kabhi hum aage, kabhi aap, aaj aapne pakad liya, mubarak ho aapko. Jisko jo karna hai karlo (I had left home for martyrdom. What can I do? Today you caught me. Congratulations. \"Surrender nahi kar sakta. Jo meri kismat may likha hoga, Allah wahi karega, theek hai? (I won't surrender. Allaah would do whatever is there in my fate)\" Dujana went on to say. Dujana, who belonged to Pakistan, was Lashkar-e-Taiba's divisional commander in south Kashmir.

      "The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India FSSAI is in the process of creating network of food banking partners to collect and distribute leftover food from large parties and weddings to the hungry.A notification to create separate category of food business operators FBOs who will be licensed to deal only with leftover food has been drafted to ensure the quality of food We are looking at partnering with NGOs or organisations that collect store and distribute surplus food to ensure they maintain certain hygiene and health standards when handling food said Pawan Agarwal CEO of FSSAI Tonnes of food is wasted annually We are looking at creating mechanism through which food can be collected from restaurants weddings large-scale parties says Pawan Agarwal All food whether it is paid for or distributed free must meet the country food safety and hygiene standards he said.The organisations in the business of collecting leftover food will now have to work in collaboration with FSSAI so their efforts can be scaled up Tonnes of food is wasted annually and can be used to feed several thousands We are looking at creating mechanism through which food can be collected from restaurants weddings large-scale parties etc said Agarwal.The initiative will set up helpline network where organisations can call in for collection but reaching individuals who want to directly donate food will take time We will have central helpline number Reaching people at the household level may not be feasible initially but it is an integral part of the long-term plan he said We have begun collecting names of people working in the sector There are still few months to go before the scheme materialises said Agarwal Collecting food going waste to feed the hungry is noble thought but to transport store and maintain the cold chain of cooked food is huge challenge The logistics are nightmare which is why we don handle leftovers and only distribute uncooked food that can be cooked locally said Kuldip Nar founder of Delhi NCR Food Bank which has been feeding the poor in 10 cities since 2011.\n",

    "#### Skip-Thought Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way to generate fixed length vector representations for each sentence in our reviews. These representations should encode the inherent semantics and the meaning of the corresponding sentence. The well known Skip-Gram Word2Vec method for generating word embeddings can give us word embeddings for individual words that are present in our model’s vocabulary (some [fancier approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606) can also generate embeddings for words which are not in the model vocabulary using subword information).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For sentence embeddings, one easy way is to take a weighted sum of the word vectors for the words contained in the sentence. We take a weighted sum because frequently occurring words such as ‘and’, ‘to’ and ‘the’, provide little or no information about the sentence. Some rarely occurring words, which are unique to a few sentences have much more representative power. Hence, we take the weights as being inversely related to the frequency of word occurrence. This method is described in detail in this [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these unsupervised methods do not take the sequence of words in the sentence into account. This may incur undesirable losses in model performance. To overcome this, I chose to instead train a Skip-Thought sentence encoder in a supervised manner using Wikipedia dumps as training data. The Skip-Thoughts model consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encoder Network: The encoder is typically a GRU-RNN which generates a fixed length vector representation h(i) for each sentence S(i) in the input. The encoded representation h(i) is obtained by passing final hidden state of the GRU cell (i.e. after it has seen the entire sentence) to multiple dense layers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decoder Network: The decoder network takes this vector representation h(i) as input and tries to generate two sentences — S(i-1) and S(i+1), which could occur before and after the input sentence respectively. Separate decoders are implemented for generation of previous and next sentences, both being GRU-RNNs. The vector representation h(i) acts as the initial hidden state for the GRUs of the decoder networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset containing a sequence of sentences, the decoder is expected to generate the previous and next sentences, word by word. The encoder-decoder network is trained to minimize the sentence reconstruction loss, and in doing so, the encoder learns to generate vector representations which encode enough information for the decoder, so that it can generate neighboring sentences. These learned representations are such that embeddings of semantically similar sentences are closer to each other in vector space, and therefore are suitable for clustering. The sentences in our emails are given as input to the encoder network to obtain the desired vector representations. This Skip-Thoughts approach for obtaining sentence embeddings is described in detail in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06726).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Skipthought code can be found [here](https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustering  \n",
    "After generating sentence embeddings for each sentence in an review, the approach is to cluster these embeddings in high-dimensional vector space into a pre-defined number of clusters. The number of clusters will be equal to desired number of sentences in the summary. I chose the numbers of sentences in the summary to be equal to the square root of the total number of sentence in the review. One can also have it as being equal to, say, _30%_ of the total number of sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summarization  \n",
    "Each cluster of sentence embeddings can be interpreted as a set of semantically similar sentences whose meaning can be expressed by just one candidate sentence in the summary. The candidate sentence is chosen to be the sentence whose vector representation is closest to the cluster center. Candidate sentences corresponding to each cluster are then ordered to form a summary for a review. The order of the candidate sentences in the summary is determined by the positions of the sentences in their corresponding clusters in the original review. For example, a candidate sentence is chosen as the first line in the summary if most of the sentences that lie in its cluster occur at the beginning of the review.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*As this method essentially extracts some candidate sentences from the text to form a summary, it is known as Extractive Sumarization*\n",

      "The government said in the Supreme Court on Friday that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been asked to explore the option of putting jammers to prevent students from accessing online child pornography in school.The court was hearing a petition seeking a directive to the government to block all websites hosting pornographic content.Additional solicitor general Pinky Anand said that 3,522 sites were blocked in June, but ruled out installing jammers in school buses as part of steps to prevent youngsters from being abused sexually on the internet.?It?s not possible to have jammers in buses, but to install them inside school premise is under consideration. The CBSE has been instructed to take up the issue with school managements,? Anand said.The CBSE is the country?s top school board and more than 10,000 institutions are affiliated to it.Most schools teach computers and the internet has become part of the curriculum, enhancing knowledge as well as putting the students at risk of being sexually exploited online. Children in school buses accessing porn on mobile phones remain a grey area.There is no accurate data on the number of Indian children being exploited in pornographic material as many victims do not go to police because of fear and shame. There were 96 reports of children being sexually exploited online in 2015, according to National Crimes Records Bureau data.The government told a three-judge bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra that it will take steps to deal with the ?situation in its entirety?.It said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) shares an Interpol list on online child sexual abuse material with the government, which then orders internet service providers to block these sites. This list is updated regularly.India doesn?t have a centralised mechanism to monitor websites containing child porn. A government committee has suggested that internet service providers should disable such sites until the monitoring system is created.Besides, the service providers were asked to spread awareness among subscribers about the use of parental control filters in their machines.\n",

      "A Gurgaon district court on Monday awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment to a blind man, a trainee probationary officer at a public sector bank, who was found guilty of raping a 33-year-old blind widow repeatedly on the pretext of marriage. The court also imposed a penalty on convict Saurabh Kapoor, 35, who was convicted of rape under Section 376 of the IPC.Additional Sessions Judge Rajni Yadav, while pronouncing the quantum of sentence, said that given the inhumanity of the act, it was required to impose upon the convict substantive and stern sentence that would commensurate with the gravity of the offence and also serve as an example to others.It is to be noted that since both the victim and the accused were blind, the court had relied upon ?voice identification? that helped the woman to identify Kapoor, a resident of Mayur Vihar in Delhi.On the pretext of meeting an advocate, Kapoor had taken the victim on May 30, 2015, to a guest house in Gurgaon and raped her there for the first time. He later continued to abuse her, promising marriage.The victim, who has an eight-year-old daughter, worked in a private company in 2015, when the incident happened. She is currently unemployed.Public prosecutor Arvind Sharma said that the convict tried to seek leniency from the court on account of his blindness.?The accused also argued that he is a government servant and highly qualified, but all these arguments were rejected by the court, which awarded him 10 years of imprisonment,? said Sharma, adding that the court has imposed a penalty of Rs 10,000, out of which Rs 8,000 would go to the victim. The remaining Rs 2000 would go to the state. If the accused fail to pay the fine, he will face one more year of imprisonment.The judge, in her order, also stated that undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence to the accused would do more harm as it will undermine the public confidence.?Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am not inclined to take a lenient view against him and release him on probation. He has raped a young woman who was helpless, defenceless, vulnerable and an easy prey who trusted the convict so much that she surrendered herself to him. He used, violated and exploited her body,? the court said.District attorney Lal Singh Yadav said the court has given a strong message to the society. ?The convict had sexually exploited the victim on the pretext of marriage,? he said.\n",

      "Bengaluru, Jul 20 (PTI) A musician played the guitar on the operation table as he underwent a surgery at a private hospital here for a rare movement disorder affecting guitarists. The successful brain circuit surgery, believed to be the first such operation in the country, was performed on July 11 by a team of doctors from Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain Hospital on 37-year-old Abishek Prasad, who has a passion for the guitar, to rid him of the neurological disorder guitarist dystonia that had crippled his fingers. During the entire surgery, the patient was fully awake and was playing the guitar as the problem only occurred when he tried playing guitar. So the feedback from the patient was important to get the exact location of the target, doctors told reporters here today. Expressing joy over the successful procedure, Prasad, a native of Bihar, said even the doctor did not expect 100 per cent result. \"It was a great feeling for both me and the doctor. It was 100 per cent result on the operation table itself. Im very excited, finally now I can live my dream, can play my guitar again after one month of recovery... \"Now my fingers are completely listening to me, earlier my fingers were erect and changing from one chord to other was difficult,\" he added. Prasad had developed the problem with his left hand fingers resulting in difficulty to move his little finger, and the trouble grew gradually into disability because of which he had to abandon playing guitar. After consulting various specialists, Prasad was referred to the doctors at the BMJ hospital here. Calling it a rare disorder, neurologist Dr Sanjiv C C who specialises in movement disorders, said it occurs to one per cent among professional musicians. \"If the medical management that included Botulinum toxin and drugs fails, then surgery is the next option,\" he said. \n",
